# lestchat
hey this is naman bansal

this is the backend of the project.

otp is set 123456 but nodemailer is configured and can be used by enetering mail credentials.
-> user need to input name and email ,an otp will be sent and chat screen will appear.
-> chat were initially stored in firebase firestore but due to exceeding reads it is shifted to json file.

->first run the backend npm start.
then run front (react) cd letschat -> npm start.
user can only message right now.

thanks
